# Specification Quality Checklist: 美股预测仪表盘

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

Validation notes:

- The spec is written in user-focused language and avoids implementation details. (PASS)
- Requirements include clear, testable function signatures for core logic (`predict_next_prices`) and a mockable data fetch interface (`fetch_prices`). (PASS)
- Success criteria are measurable (time targets and coverage percentages) and technology-agnostic. (PASS)
- Edge cases and assumptions are present. (PASS)

No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were used. All mandatory sections from the spec template are completed.

Detailed validation results:

- Content Quality

  - No implementation details: PASS — spec avoids mentioning frameworks or languages.
  - Focused on user value: PASS — user stories and acceptance criteria are user-centric.
  - Written for non-technical stakeholders: PASS — language is plain and explanatory.
  - All mandatory sections completed: PASS — template sections populated.

- Requirement Completeness

  - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain: PASS
  - Requirements are testable and unambiguous: PASS — each FR has an acceptance-style description or a callable function signature.
  - Success criteria are measurable: PASS — includes time-based and percentage targets.
  - Success criteria are technology-agnostic: PASS
  - All acceptance scenarios are defined: PASS — user stories include acceptance scenarios.
  - Edge cases are identified: PASS — network/data shortage/timeout handled.
  - Scope is clearly bounded: PASS — MVP vs optional features called out.
  - Dependencies and assumptions identified: PASS — data source availability and governance constraints noted.

- Feature Readiness
  - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria: PASS
  - User scenarios cover primary flows: PASS
  - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria: PASS (subject to implementation)
  - No implementation details leak into specification: PASS

No automated failures detected. Checklist marked as all-pass based on current spec content. If you want stricter or additional checks (security/privacy, data licensing), I can add them.
